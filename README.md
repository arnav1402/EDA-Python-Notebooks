# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python. The goal of this project is to explore and visualize a dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can help inform further modeling or business decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To get started with this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnav1402/EDA-Python-Notebooks.git
cd EDA-Python-Notebooks
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
For MacOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

### 4. Key Features of the Analysis
‚úÖ Handling missing values and data cleaning
‚úÖ Univariate and bivariate visualizations
‚úÖ Correlation heatmaps and statistical summaries
‚úÖ Outlier detection
‚úÖ Optional: Feature engineering and hypothesis testing
